        with over 600m2 of space, two floors and over 90 gaming station seats (PC). Thanks to that,
        we have a possibility of renting a gaming rig to compete on fair grounds against the other
        players. BaseStack provides attendees with not only whole gaming rigs, but also peripherals.
        People who are used to playing with their favourite mouses and keyboards are welcome to take
        their own peripherals. The place is known for its tournaments, hosted every weekend, that
        gain sizeable popularity on TikTok.
